                <p class="recap-text">Murder Drones are an animated sci-fi comedy created by Glitch Productions and Liam Vickers. 
                    The story takes place on the exoplanet Copper 9, where all humans died due to a massive explosion —
                    a mistake of their own. However, people on Earth blame the mining drones and send special murder drones 
                    to eliminate them. The story begins when a worker drone named Uzi, tired of hiding behind three massive doors, 
                    builds a railgun to fight back. But she soon discovers that one of the murder drones, named N, may not be as
                    murderous as she imagined.</p>

                        <br>Uzi is the main character of the show. She’s a worker drone and the daughter of Khan and Nori. 
                        <br>Driven by a desire to avenge her fellow worker drones, she initially fights against SD-N. 
                        <br>However, after their first battle, she forms a strong friendship with him — one that eventually

                        <br>With N as her only friend, Uzi discovers that she is possessed by the Absolute Solver, an 
                        <br>immensely powerful eldritch intelligence that influences her actions. 
                        <br>After the events of “Absolute End,” she learns to control it and use its power by her own will. 
                        <br>'In the same event, she swallows Cyn’s core, which now lives inside her tail.
