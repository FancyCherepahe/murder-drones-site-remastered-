                <p class="recap-text">Murder Drones are an animated sci-fi comedy created by Glitch Productions and Liam Vickers. 
                    The story takes place on the exoplanet Copper 9, where all humans died due to a massive explosion —
                    a mistake of their own. However, people on Earth blame the mining drones and send special murder drones 
                    to eliminate them. The story begins when a worker drone named Uzi, tired of hiding behind three massive doors, 
                    builds a railgun to fight back. But she soon discovers that one of the murder drones, named N, may not be as
                    murderous as she imagined.</p>

                        <br>Uzi is the main character of the show. She’s a worker drone and the daughter of Khan and Nori. 
                        <br>Driven by a desire to avenge her fellow worker drones, she initially fights against SD-N. 
                        <br>However, after their first battle, she forms a strong friendship with him — one that eventually 
                        <br>develops into a romantic relationship. 
                        <br>With N as her only friend, Uzi discovers that she is possessed by the Absolute Solver, an 
                        <br>immensely powerful eldritch intelligence that influences her actions. 
                        <br>After the events of “Absolute End,” she learns to control it and use its power by her own will. 
                        <br>'In the same event, she swallows Cyn’s core, which now lives inside her tail.

                    <br>Serial Designation N (often just called N) is a disassembly drone sent to Copper-9 by JCJenson to 
                    <br>eliminate all “runaway AI,” better known as worker drones.
                    <br>While his past remains foggy, it’s hinted that he was once a worker drone serving in a castle-like estate 
                    <br>before being repurposed.Unlike most disassembly drones, N stands out for his kind-hearted and awkward personality. 
                    <br>N quickly becomes fascinated by Uzi’s rebellious spirit, and despite their rocky first encounter, he forms a close 
                    <br>bond with her — one that grows into a romantic relationship. He is known for his clumsy charm, loyalty, 
                    <br>and eagerness to please, often trying to prove himself to both his fellow drones and Uzi.Despite being underestimated 
                    <br>by other disassembly drones (especially V), N demonstrates surprising bravery and determination when protecting his friends.

                        <br>Serial Designation V is a disassembly drone sent to Copper‑9 by JCJenson to eliminate worker drones. 
                        <br>Unlike N, she fully embraces her role as a killer, showing little remorse and often enjoying the hunt. 
                        <br>V is sarcastic, ruthless, and confident in her abilities, often mocking N for his kindness and clumsiness.
                        <br>Her past is less explored, but she represents the cold, corporate side of the drones — loyal to her 
                        <br>programming and driven by destruction. Despite this, moments of vulnerability suggest there may be
                        <br>more beneath her violent persona. V’s relationship with N is complicated: she belittles him, yet relies 
                        <br>on his support during missions. Her encounters with Uzi highlight her as both a dangerous enemy and a 
                        <br>character with hidden depth.
